Disappeardle is Wordle, with a twist. It accepts 5 letter guesses and will still tell you if your letters are correct, and in the correct position (green) or correct, but in the wrong position (yellow), but it will hide your previous guesses from you, forcing you to rely on your memory to solve the puzzle. 

Dissapeardle was developed with Nalvi Tran as a project for Computer Science 241: Object Oriented Programming, in 2022.
